# Micro-Mouse Design Project - KiCad Files

## üìñ Overview
This repository contains documentation, schematics, and PCB files used during the design of the Micro-Mouse Power Board.
There were a few issues with our original KiCad file getting corrupted so we had to copy its contents into a new KiCad project file.

## üìÅ Important Files

The most recent and completed version of the project files can be found along the following file path:
- `Power Board/EEE3088F Power Board/NEW_KICAD` ‚Äì Main KiCad project files (schematic, PCB, BOM etc...)

This 'NEW_KICAD' folder contains:
- Project files (schematic and PCB)
- Imported footprint and symbol files
- Production Files in `Power Board/EEE3088F Power Board/NEW_KICAD/jlcpcb/production_files` (BOM, CPL, GERBER files)
- A few other 3D Model and library files we made trying to import random things (Please forgive us if this is a mess, most of the importing was done at 3am ;) )
